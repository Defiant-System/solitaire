## Solitaire Classic
The goal is to move all cards to the four **foundations** on the upper right.

### Turning and Moving
Click the **stock** (on the upper left) to turn over cards onto the **waste pile**.
Drag cards to move them between the waste pile, the seven **tableau** columns (at the bottom), and the four foundations. You can also double-click cards instead of dragging them to a foundation.

You may move single cards or piles of cards within the tableau. You may only move cards *off* the waste pile, but you may *onto* and *off* the foundations.
Any time you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card is automatically turned face-up for you.

### Build Rules
Cards on the foundations need to be stacked by the same suit from Ace to King.
Cards on the tableau need to be stacked by alternating color from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace).
Empty spots on the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.

## Freecell
The goal is to move all cards to the four **foundations** on the upper left.

### Moving
You may move cards to the four **holding** cells on the upper right. The amount of free cells dictates the amount of cards you can drag from a pile.
One free cell means, you can move two cards. Two free cells means, you can move three cards...so on and so forth.

### Build Rules
Cards on the foundations need to be stacked by the same suit from Ace to King.
Cards on the tableau need to be stacked by alternating color from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Empty spots on the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.

## Spider
The goal is to move all cards to the eight **foundations** at the top.

### Turning and Moving
Drag cards to move them between the ten **tableau** columns at the bottom.
Click the **stock** (on the upper left) to deal a new card onto each tableau column.

When thirteen cards of the same suit from King all the way to Ace are together on a tableau column, they are automatically moved to the foundations.
Any time you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card is automatically turned face-up for you.

### Build Rules
Tableau columns are built down by suit.
Empty spots on the tableau can be filled with any card.

## Yukon
The objective in Yukon, like most Solitaire games, is to move all the cards from the Tableau onto the four Foundation piles.
Each Foundation has one suit and you must put the cards onto them in ascending order starting from the Ace.

### Turning and Moving
Move one or more cards from one Tableau pile to another. You can move many faceup cards together in the Tableau, **even if they're not ordered**.
Any time you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card is automatically turned face-up for you.

### Build Rules
Cards on the foundations need to be stacked by the same suit from Ace to King.
